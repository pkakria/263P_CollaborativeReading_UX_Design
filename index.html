            <p>  Today people are
                  reading lesser books than before, reading a book to the end requires commitment of
                  time and attention which is difficult to give when social life is disconnected from a digital
                  book reading experience. This leads to many unfinished books and less enthusiasm in
                  the habit of reading. Therefore, people might not be fully engaged in reading their
                  books.<br></br>A system which could help users to provide an environment where they can share their thoughts on different book topics and
                  have conversations with other book readers. Such an environment could help people
                  stay more focused on the book they are reading by making them more enthusiastic
                  about the reading activity.

          <h2>Initial Idea</h2>
          <p>we designed a platform that helps people stay engaged in reading
            for a longer time by allowing them to see and comment on the progress of other users.
            In addition, this system would allow the readers to share their thoughts on a book topic
            with other users to keep them engaged in reading and in conversation about books. We
            want to provide a social environment for book readers so that they feel enthusiastic to
            keep reading more with friends and are also able to see the insights from other readers
            on unread chapters of a book which keeps up their interest in finishing a book.<br>
