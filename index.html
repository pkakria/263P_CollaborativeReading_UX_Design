            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>  Today people are
                  reading lesser books than before, reading a book to the end requires commitment of
                  time and attention which is difficult to give when social life is disconnected from a digital
                  book reading experience. This leads to many unfinished books and less enthusiasm in
                  the habit of reading. Therefore, people might not be fully engaged in reading their
                  books. <br/> A system which could help users to provide an environment where they can share their thoughts on different book topics and
                  have conversations with other book readers. Such an environment could help people
                  stay more focused on the book they are reading by making them more enthusiastic
                  about the reading activity.

          <h2>Competitors</h2>
          <p>We did three competitive analysis during the early stage of designing.</p>
          <h3>Google Play Books</h3>
          <p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/books" target="_blank">Google Play Books</a> 
            provides users their next books to read, add bookmarks, change the display layout, add personal notes, search texts, and change chapters easily while they are reading.The system has functions that allow readers to make notes, obtain translations, change themes, go to different chapters, change textviews, etc. Readers can go to each chapter easily by selecting the page numbers. They can adjust the font and background of the pages and also add bookmarks to the book. We decided to incorporate these two features of bookmarks and change the background of the reading page in our project.
          </p>
          <h3>Kindle</h3>
          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle" target="_blank">Kindle</a> 
            is a small, lightweight and portable device, a huge number of books can be stored on it. Readers can go through and read different books on this small device or on the Kindle app from their phone and can annotate or bookmark the contents whenever something catches their attention. In our system, we want to incorporate the book search options for the users to find their favorite books. However, Kindle doesn’t let different users collaborate on one book, and it doesn’t provide a social environment for its users. Therefore, our system attempts to fix that by providing a platform where readers can collaborate and share their thoughts.            
          </p>
          <h3>Goodreads</h3>
          <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/" target="_blank">Goodreads</a> 
            provides the flexibility to its users to review their favorite books stored in their shelves online anywhere and anytime. Its user base has grown to 20 millions users up to now. It gives a platform for readers to share their book review and for other users to read these reviews and make the decision on the next book to read, it provides the sense of community by running reading challenges, compiling best books lists under different categories. Since Goodreads users feel a sense of positivity after reading the friends comments on their reads, we attempt to come up with such a feature to help our users to get this positive feeling by sharing the unread part from their reads and motivating their friends to read.

          <h2>User Personas</h2>
          <p>To identify the user’s needs of our study, we have conducted user research which
            includes interviews with 9 users ranging from active readers to infrequent readers. The
            aim of these interviews was to find out their reading habits, motivation around
            choosing a book, tracking what they have read and want to share with their friends
            and family and what challenges they faced during reading.</p>

            Many readers prefer reading in a group for different reasons

            Students like to read together and share the insights among them

          <li>
            People find their next book to read through online book recommendations
          </li>
          <li>
            Some people prefer hard copies because they find online reading interfaces complex

          We used the affinity diagram technique to synthesize the findings and uncover insights from the data that
          helped us to identify user needs. From each interview, we created notes and thoughts using sticky notes on <a href="https://miro.com/app/dashboard/" target="_blank">Miro
          </a> and grouped each of them into four user types. 
          This grouping helped us to identify the behavioral patterns of user needs.</p>
