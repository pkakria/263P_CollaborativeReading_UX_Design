  <p style="font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Today people are
  reading lesser books than before, reading a book to the end requires commitment of
  time and attention which is difficult to give when social life is disconnected from a digital
  book reading experience. This leads to many unfinished books and less enthusiasm in
  the habit of reading. Therefore, people might not be fully engaged in reading their
  books.<br>We want to design a system which could help with this problem. The users might
  need an environment where they can share their thoughts on different book topics and
  have conversations with other book readers. Such an environment could help people
  stay more focused on the book they are reading by making them more enthusiastic
  about the reading activity.

<h2>Initial Idea</h2>
<p style="font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">we designed a system that helps people stay engaged in reading
  for a longer time by allowing them to see and comment on the progress of other users.
  In addition, this system would allow the readers to share their thoughts on a book topic
  with other users to keep them engaged in reading and in conversation about books. We
  want to provide a social environment for book readers so that they feel enthusiastic to
  keep reading more with friends and are also able to see the insights from other readers
  on unread chapters of a book which keeps up their interest in finishing a book.<br>
